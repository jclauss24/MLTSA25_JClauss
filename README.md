# MTLSA25_JClauss

I decided to take this class to learn more about machine learning, and gain the skills to be able to use this resource in my research going forward if needed.

I hope to learn how to apply machine learning to various research scenarios, and be able to apply the skills I learn going forward in my own research.

I have a good amount of experience coding in python, as well as some knowledge in various other coding languages.
